If the Customer is a legal person, these Terms and Conditions are accepted on behalf of the Customer. This is a business to business service only and there is no intention to create a contract with any consumer, if you are a consumer and wish to use the Application then first contact us on&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sanjeevan@outlook.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">sanjeevan@outlook.com</a></p>
                                        <p><a href="mailto:sanjeevan@outlook.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"></a>1.2 Legal firms, audit and accounting firms, management agencies and the like may also accept these Terms and Conditions on behalf of the Customer, for example in relation to new subscriptions, and in doing so they represent that they have the necessary authority to do so and that the Customer has been duly informed of these Terms and Conditions prior to acceptance.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>2. SUBSCRIPTION TERM AND INVOICING</p>
                                        <p>2.1 The subscription becomes effective upon placement of order and continues to be in effect until terminated in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>2.2 The first invoicing period runs from the order date for one year. After that, invoicing takes place yearly in advance, unless otherwise set out in separate agreement or terms for the specific product.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>2.3 After placement of order, new customers are entitled to cancel the order free of charge within a period of 30 days (money back guarantee on License fees).</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>3. SCOPE AND USE OF SUBSCRIPTION</p>
                                        <p>3.1 In accordance with these Terms and Conditions, the Customer is granted a non-exclusive limited right to use the Application and selected additional modules (collectively the "Application") which are made available online as software as a service only for the purposes described by the Application. The Customer does not acquire the Application or any copy or part and is not granted a license to implement the Application in any way other than as a software as a service.</p>
                                        <p>3.2 The Customer's subscription entitles the Customer to use the Application for the number of entries, users, additional modules, etc. specified by GRESSQUEL. If the Customer needs further capacity or functionality, then upon use of any additional entries, users or modules by the Customer or upon any acceptance by GRESSQUEL of any requested increase to entries, users or modules, the subscription will be upgraded automatically and the Customer shall agree to pay the consequential increase in the subscription at the then current rates for such entries, users and modules.&nbsp;<br> 3.3 The Application itself or GRESSQUEL's website may provide a list of subscription types and selected additional modules. Some functionalities, services and additional modules may be subject to separate terms and conditions, which must be accepted in addition to these Terms and Conditions before use.</p>
                                        <p>3.4 Only the Customer and its advisors are entitled to use the Application, and the Application may not be used for or on behalf of any other parties or for data processing or the provision of services for other parties than the Customer. The Customer agrees to be fully responsible and liable for any third parties that are given access to the Application by the Customer or who use the Customer’s log in details.</p>
                                        <p>3.5 Other than as set out in 3.4, the Customer is not entitled to assign the subscription or grant access to the Application, whether in full or in part, to any third party.</p>
                                        <p>3.6 The Customer shall ensure that the Application is not used in any manner which reflects adversely upon the name, reputation and/or goodwill of GRESSQUEL or in breach of any applicable laws or regulations.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

If the subscription fee remains unpaid, reminder 2 will be sent 10 days later and a reminder fee of 50 USD will be charged. If payment is not received within 10 days after reminder 2, access to the Application will be blocked. Access to the Application will be unblocked after receipt of payment, unless GRESSQUEL has already cancelled the subscription.</p>
                                        <p>4.3 The Customer accepts that invoices and reminders sent by email to the email address provided by the Customer shall be deemed delivered when sent by GRESSQUEL.<br> 4.4 The prices, rates and subscription types in force from time to time can be found on GRESSQUEL's website and may be changed at the end of each calendar quarter on one month's notice. All prices exclude VAT which might be applied at the prevailing rate in some jurisdictions.</p>

                                        <p>5.2 GRESSQUEL is entitled to terminate the subscription at the end of any calendar month, quarter or year by giving a 15 days’ notice or immediately on written notice if the Customer commits a material breach of these Terms and Conditions or becomes insolvent or has a receiver or administrator appointed over its assets.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

The Application permits the Customer to export records and data held by the Application and the Customer agrees to export any and all data prior to termination of the subscription.

                                        <p>6.4 GRESSQUEL may disclose Customer data to third parties and public authorities where such disclosure in GRESSQUEL’s opinion is justifiable and reasonable, e.g. to avoid a loss of value, including in connection with judgments, public authority orders, the Customer's bankruptcy, death or the like.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

The Application and the service is provided “as is” and GRESSQUEL expressly disclaims any further representations, warranties, conditions or other terms, express or implied, by statute, collaterally or otherwise, including but not limited to implied warranties, conditions or other terms of satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose or reasonable care and skill.</p>
                                        <p>7.2 In the event of an interruption of service GRESSQUEL will use reasonable commercial endeavours to restore normal operations as soon as possible.</p>
                                        <p>7.3 Planned interruptions will mainly take place based on prior notifications to the Customer.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
